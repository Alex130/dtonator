Automatic DTO Generation and Mapping
------------------------------------

dtonator automates the tedious aspect of maintaining a DTO layer for exposing domain objects for the wire. Whether for REST or AJAX interfaces, dtonator's purpose is to make it as easy as possible to expose your domain objects in whatever structure you intend.

Currently, dtonator is primarily used for generating GWT-RPC compatible DTOs, and also generating client-side models for use in [Tessell](http://www.tessell.org); however, neither of these is required, it's just what I use dtonator for.


Screencast
----------

Here is a brief screencast of dtonator's workflow:

<p>
  <a href="http://www.tessell.org/casts/first.flv" style="display:block;width:520px;height:330px;margin-left:1em;" id="player"> </a>
  <script type="text/javascript"><!-- 
    flowplayer("player", "casts/flowplayer-3.2.7.swf", { clip: { autoPlay: false } });
  --></script>
</p>

Foo.
